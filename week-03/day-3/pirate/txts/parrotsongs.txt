Leave her, Johnny, leave her!
Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her!
For the voyage is long and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her.

Under Jolly Roger...
Fly our flag, we teach them fear
Capture them, the end is near
Firing guns they shell burn
Surrender or fight there's no return
Under Jolly Roger...
