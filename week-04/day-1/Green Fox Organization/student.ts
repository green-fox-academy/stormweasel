Create a Student class that has the same fields and methods as the Person class, 
and has the following additional

fields:

previousOrganization: the name of the studentâ€™s previous company / school
skippedDays: the number of days skipped from the course
methods:
getGoal(): prints out 'My goal is: Be a junior software developer.'
introduce(): 'Hi, I'm name, a age year old gender from previousOrganization 
							who skipped skippedDays days from the course already.'
skipDays(numberOfDays): increases skippedDays by numberOfDays

The Student class has the following constructors:

Student(name, age, gender, previousOrganization): beside the given parameters, it sets skippedDays to 0

					 skippedDays to 0
